Each night, I silently pray.

I pray for courage.

Courage to be.

Courage to be bold.

Courage to try.

Courage to fail.

Courage to believe.

Believe that I could succeed.

That I will succeed.

Courage to accept.

Accept that I might fail.

Fail to succeed.

My friends, in the years to come.

When you become witness.

Witness to the product of my courage.

Of believing.

Of becoming.

The gory and glory.

Or you might have already.

When you become presented with the gift of my courage.

And my skin becomes bare to you.

And I lay bare with scars.

Scars, scars.

Scars from the thorns of courage.

Scars.

That remind one of the road to becoming.

To self discovering.

To finding ones life’s purpose.

The road that often is paved with thorns.

Thorns.

Scars.

Scars that reminds us of the lessons learnt.

Or still learning.

Scars.

So raw, it can feel just like yesterday.

So old, it feels like a lifetime.

Scars.

When you see my scars,

I hope you be loud if you wish,

But I pray you be gentle.

Gentle with your criticism.

Generous with your advise.

For every scar carries a lesson.

And every lesson carve a better path.

I hope.

So I pray.

That, I shall remain humble to life’s lesson.

And that I shall have the courage to fail.

To hold myself accountable.

To be.

With this courage.

With your kindness.

Your grace.

And guidance.

I hope to serve you with all that I have.
